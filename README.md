# OkeSignal-Real-Time-Hand-Gesture-Interaction-via-MediaPipe-and-JavaScript
# OkeSignal 💬🖐️

**OkeSignal** is a lightweight and interactive web-based application that detects hand gestures in real-time using a webcam, powered by [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how symbolic hand gestures can trigger custom visual feedback, enabling playful yet meaningful interaction between humans and computers.

## 🚀 Features

* Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
* Detection of a specific "okesip" gesture (a customized version of the classic finger-heart 💖)
* Dynamic visual effects (hearts, messages, etc.) when gesture is detected
* Simple and responsive UI for a fun and engaging experience

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5 + CSS3
* [MediaPipe Hands](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker)
* Canvas API for rendering visuals
* Webcam API for real-time interaction

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/okesignal.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome recommended)
3. Allow webcam access and do the "okesip" gesture in front of the camera
4. Enjoy the magic ✨

## 🤔 Why OkeSignal?

Originally inspired by a personal story, this project explores how **simple technology + symbolic gestures** can create *meaningful, emotional experiences*. Beyond fun, it opens doors to deeper HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) concepts such as:

* Gesture-to-command mapping
* Emotion-driven UI
* Symbolic input systems

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Support for more gestures (thumbs up, peace, etc.)
* Mobile-friendly interface
* Sound/audio feedback
* Gesture training mode using ML
